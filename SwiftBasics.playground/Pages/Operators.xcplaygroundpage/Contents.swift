// Basic Operators
/*
 An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values.
 Eg: the addition operator (+) adds two numbers and the logical AND operator (&&) combines two Boolean values.
*/
let a = 1 + 2
print("Addition:",a)
// Unary Operators: operates on single operand(eg: -a, !a, a!).
var Three = 3
var minusThree = -Three
var plusThree = -minusThree
print("Three",Three)
print("Minus Three:",minusThree)
print("Plus Three:",plusThree)

// Ternary Operators: operates on triple operand(eg: a ? b : c)
// Assignment Operator: initializes or updates the value of operands.
var b = 3
var c = 6
b = c
print("value of b:",b)
print("value of c:",c)

// Arithmetic Operators.
// Binary Operators: operates on double operand(eg: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b)
var x1 = 3 + 2
print("Addition:",x1)

var x2 = 3 - 2
print("Subtraction:",x2)

var x3 = 3 * 3
print("Multiplication:",x3)

var x4 = 5 / 5
print("Division:",x4)

var x5 = 9 % 4
print("Remainder Operator:",x5)

var x6 = -9 % 4
print("Remainder Operator:",x6)

// NOTE: (+) operator is also used to concatenate the strings.
var str = "Hello, " + "Swift"
print("Concatenation:",str)
